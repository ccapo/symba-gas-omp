This is a numerical integrator used to accurately compute the orbits
of celestial bodies using the SyMBA algorithm. The code computes the
mutual gravity between M large massive bodies and N small massive bodies,
but does not compute the mutual gravity between the N small massive bodies.

This code also includes a prescription for aerodynamic gas drag for small
bodies, and tidal torques for the large bodies assuming the presence of a
circumstellar gaseous disk.

This code has also been parallelized using OpenMP directives, but is only
designed to handle scenarios where M < 1000.
